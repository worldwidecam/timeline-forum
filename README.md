# Timeline Forum

An interactive web application for creating and visualizing timelines with events. Events are displayed on a horizontal timeline with year markers and can be expanded for more details.

## Features

- Create multiple timelines
- Add events to timelines with titles, dates, and descriptions
- Visual timeline display with:
  - Year markers
  - Interactive event cards
  - Hover effects
  - Diagonal connecting lines
- Chronological event ordering
- Expandable event details

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/worldwidecam/timeline-forum.git
cd timeline-forum
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```
The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the React development server:
```bash
npm start
```
The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Start both backend and frontend servers
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
3. Click "Create Timeline" to create a new timeline
4. In a timeline view, click "Create Event" to add events
5. Events will appear on the timeline in chronological order
6. Hover over events to see the hover effect
7. Click on events to expand/collapse their details

## Timeline Component Glossary

### Visual Elements
- **Fret**: The space between time markers on the timeline. These are designed to be equidistant to create a consistent visual rhythm.
  - Reference: `TimelineView.js:144` (spacing calculation)

- **Endpoint**: The circular marker at the start of the timeline ("Beginning") and the arrow at the end ("Present day").
  - Reference: `TimelineView.js:314` (endpoint styling)

- **Event Dot**: The small circular markers on the timeline that represent individual events. These have a larger clickable area for better interaction.
  - Reference: `TimelineView.js:380` (event dot container)

- **Time Marker**: The vertical lines with timestamps that divide the timeline into equal segments.
  - Reference: `TimelineView.js:142` (generateTimeMarkers function)

### Technical Terms
- **Padding**: The empty space at the start (3%) and end of the timeline to prevent events from being too close to the edges.
  - Reference: `TimelineView.js:135` (calculatePosition function)

- **Available Space**: The percentage of the timeline's width (94%) that's available for content between the padding.
  - Reference: `TimelineView.js:145` (availableSpace constant)

- **Time Boundaries**: The calculated start and end times for the timeline, which adjust based on the time span of events.
  - Reference: `TimelineView.js:112` (getTimelineBoundaries function)

### Time Formats
- **Same-day**: Shows hours (e.g., "2PM")
- **Within-week**: Shows day and hour (e.g., "Wed 2PM")
- **Within-year**: Shows month and day (e.g., "Dec 13")
- **Multi-year**: Shows month and year (e.g., "Dec 2023")
  - Reference: `TimelineView.js:149-166` (time format logic)

## Development

To make changes:
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
2. Make your changes
3. Commit: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
4. Push: `git push origin feature-name`

## Database

- SQLite database located at `backend/instance/timeline_forum.db`
- Data persists between sessions
- No additional database setup required

## Next Steps

Planned features:
- User authentication
- Event editing and deletion
- Timeline sharing
- Mobile responsiveness improvements
- Additional timeline customization options
